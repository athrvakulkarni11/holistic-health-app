# 📊 How Our Health Scoring System Works

This guide explains how we calculate your health score in a simple, easy-to-understand way. 

## The Basics: 0 to 100
We use a **0 to 100 scale**, where **Higher is Healthier**:
* **100** = Perfect health (all your markers are completely normal)
* **0** = Critical (all your markers are severely out of range)

Think of it like a grade on a test. We want to aim as high as possible!

## How We Grade You
Instead of just looking at one big number, we break your health down into specific "categories" (like Blood Health, Liver, and Heart).

1. **Category Scores:** We give each category its own 0 to 100 score. If everything in your Liver tests is normal, your Liver score is 100. If something is slightly off, the score drops a little. If it's way off, it drops a lot.
2. **Weighing What Matters Most:** Some categories impact your overall health and risk levels more than others. For example, Heart and Metabolic risks have a slightly heavier "weight" on your final score than other categories.
3. **The Final Overall Score:** We take all your category scores and combine them into one overall Health Score.

## Understanding Your Results
Based on your final score, we place your health into one of these levels so you know exactly where you stand without needing a medical degree:

* 🟢 **Excellent (85 - 100):** Looking great! Keep up the good work.
* 🟡 **Good (70 - 84):** Mostly healthy, with maybe a few minor things to keep an eye on.
* 🟠 **Moderate (50 - 69):** Some areas need your attention. We'll suggest small lifestyle or diet changes.
* 🔴 **Needs Attention (30 - 49):** Multiple areas are out of balance. We highly recommend discussing this with a doctor soon.
* ⚫ **High Risk (Below 30):** Serious health concerns detected. You should definitely consult a healthcare provider.
