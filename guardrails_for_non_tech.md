# 🛡️ How Our AI Guardrails Keep You Safe

Because we are dealing with health information, safety and privacy are our absolute top priorities. We built "Guardrails" (like bowling bumper lanes) to make sure our AI always acts responsibly. 

Here is how we keep you safe behind the scenes:

## 1. 🚨 Emergency Detection
The system is constantly looking for signs of an active medical emergency (like a heart attack, stroke, mental health crisis, or severe allergic reaction). If it spots these signs, it will immediately pause the normal chat and give you direct instructions to **call 911** or rush to the emergency room.

## 2. 🕵️ Privacy Protection 
If you accidentally type highly sensitive personal information—like a Social Security Number, credit card, or home address—the system **scrubs it and hides it** before the AI even sees your message. Your private data stays private.

## 3. 🎯 Staying On Topic
Our AI is a health expert, not a financial advisor or a coder. If someone tries to ask about the stock market, politics, or unsafe activities, the AI will gently remind them that it is here exclusively to help with health, wellness, and nutrition.

## 4. 🛑 Blocking Dangerous Advice
Before the AI sends its response to you, we screen it to guarantee it doesn't contain dangerous suggestions (like telling you to take an unsafe amount of a supplement, or skipping your currently prescribed medication). Additionally, we automatically block unapproved or unsafe file uploads.

## 5. ⚕️ Always a Helper, Never Your Doctor
We always include a medical disclaimer. The AI is incredibly smart, but it doesn't replace your actual human doctor. If the AI happens to suggest taking any new medications, the Guardrails will explicitly remind you to verify them with a real pharmacist or doctor first before proceeding.
